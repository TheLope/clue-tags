## Notes
- Degear and suicide all wildy steps. For Hot Cold wildy steps, Weiss and Ferox enclave are useful
- Death runes are taken for Vengeance
- **Holy ghrazi rapier**: Downgrades: Inquisitor's mace&rarr;Ghrazi rapier&rarr;Blade of saeldor&rarr;Abyssal tentacle
- **Hilt**: If you do not have Master or Grandmaster CAs, take a hilt in your inventory
- **Blessing**: Unholy blessing is taken with Holy ghrazi rapier, otherwise use Holy blessing
    - Without Zammy item, bank for one for the "outside K'ril Tsutsaroth's chamber" step
